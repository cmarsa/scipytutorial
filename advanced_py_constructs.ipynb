Everything that can be done with `yield` statements, could also be done with `next` methods. Nevertheless, using a function and having the interpreter perform its magic to create an iterator has advantages. A function can be much shorter than the definition of a class with the required `next` and `__iter__` methods. What is more important, it is easier for the author of the generator to understand the state which is kept in local variables, as opposed to instance attributes, which have to be used to pass data between consecutive invocations of next on an iterator object.\n",

The code to initialise the state, to decide if the loop is finished, and to find the next value is extracted into a separate place. This highlights the body of the loop — the interesting part. In addition, it is possible to reuse the iterator code in other places."

Direct communication is possible thanks to PEP 342 (implemented in 2.5). It is achieved by turning the previously boring `yield` statement into an expression. When the generator resumes execution after a `yield` statement, the caller can call a method on the generator object to either pass a value into the generator, which then is returned by the `yield` statement, or a different method to inject an exception into the generator.\n",

    "Decorators can either return the same function or class object or they can return a completely different object. In the first case, the decorator can exploit the fact that function and class objects are mutable and add attributes, e.g. add a docstring to a class. A decorator might do something useful even without modifying the object, for example register the decorated class in a global registry. In the second case, virtually anything is possible: when something different is substituted for the original function or class, the new object can be completely different. Nevertheless, such behaviour is not the purpose of decorators: they are intended to tweak the decorated object, not do something unpredictable. Therefore, when a function is “decorated” by replacing it with a different function, the new function usually calls the original function, after doing some preparatory work. Likewise, when a class is “decorated” by replacing if with a new class, the new class is usually derived from the original class. When the purpose of the decorator is to do something “every time”, like to log every call to a decorated function, only the second type of decorators can be used. On the other hand, if the first type is sufficient, it is better to use it, because it is simpler.\n"
